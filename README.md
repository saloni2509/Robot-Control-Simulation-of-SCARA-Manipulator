# Robot-Control-Simulation-of-SCARA-Manipulator
Designed Simulink models to direct it to the desired trajectory and force using inverse kinematics and controls • Verified force and torque control algorithms by loading and unloading weights on arms • Tackled various hazardous conditions such as escaping from an obstacle &amp; staying in the joint limits using redundancy
